# HandWritten Number Prediction

In applications such as postal services and banking, accurate recognition of words, letters, and digits is imperative. This project aims to enable users to predict handwritten digits through machine learning algorithms, displaying the likelihood of correctness as a percentage.
Upon completion, the system will provide users with the ability to input handwritten digits through an interface. The system will then analyze the input and generate predictions for the digits, accompanied by a percentage indicating the likelihood of correctness. This feature not only facilitates the recognition of handwritten digits but also provides users with valuable feedback on the confidence level of the predictions.


In summary, this project aims to address the challenges of handwritten digit recognition by developing a robust machine learning-based system. By leveraging Python and the MNIST dataset, the system will empower users with the ability to accurately predict handwritten digits, thereby enhancing efficiency and accuracy in various applications.
